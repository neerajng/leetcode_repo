## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for sharpening algorithm and data structure skills through practice problems. This repository serves as a record of my solutions to these problems, allowing me to track my progress and share my solutions with others.

## Usage

You can browse the solutions directly in the repository or clone it to your local machine to explore the code further. Each solution is contained within its own folder, organized by problem number. Additionally, I've provided brief explanations and time complexities for each solution to aid understanding.
